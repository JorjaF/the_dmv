Reflection

Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time. 
I spent some time just looking at the lib and the spec files just to see how they were set up. Then i went into each one and ran each test in the spec file indivually and corrected the errors as they came up

What was hard about working with code you did not write?
What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? 
I feel like the hardest part for me was the formating on the syntax, there was nothing wrong with it, the writer did vertical columns and that was different then what i do

What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
I felt like it was easier to come with some code already on the screen. sometimes i get so overwhelmed i get like vapor lock and i don't know where to start. debugging first gave me a little bit of a leg up on the coding
