# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
The first thing I did was just looked around at the code to see that i could access and what was already there. 
Next I ran each existing test in the spec file and corrected error that came up line by line.

What was hard about working with code you did not write?
It can be hard when looking at someone elses code because they may make different formating decisions that you would (like putting things in rows vs columns). Also while it didn't really happen here when working with someone elses code you are at the mercy of their varible naming conventions.

What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
I think that getting some starter code was easier for me, sometimes when i have a large project I get vapor locked and I can not even think of the smallest step i could do, i just freeze.
